Release 1.7.4, 05/28/2009

Interface to ModelLoader implemented by class ChppciOpenHrpClient have been 
homogeneized:

  1. deprecated functions have been removed,

  2. ktStatus loadHrp2Model(double inPenetration, const char *model=NULL)

     has been replaced by

     ktStatus 
     loadHrp2Model(double inPenetration, 
                   const std::string &inModel=
                   std::string("OPENHRP_PREFIX/Controller/IOserver/robot/HRP2JRL/model/HRP2JRLmain.wrl"))

     where OPENHRP_PREFIX is the installation prefix of OpenHRP resolved at
     configuration.

  3. ktStatus loadHrp2Model(ChppHumanoidRobotShPtr &outDevice, 
                            const char *model=NULL)
     has been replaced by

     ktStatus 
     loadHrp2Model(ChppHumanoidRobotShPtr &outDevice, 
                   const std::string &inModel=
                   std::string("OPENHRP_PREFIX/Controller/IOserver/robot/HRP2JRL/model/HRP2JRLmain.wrl"))

     where OPENHRP_PREFIX is the installation prefix of OpenHRP resolved at
     configuration.

  4. ktStatus 
     loadRobotModel(std::string inFilename, std::string inDeviceName, 
                    ChppDeviceShPtr &outDevice, 
                    std::string inOpenHrpPrefix=
                    std::string("OPENHRP_PREFIX"))

     has been replaced by

     ktStatus 
     loadRobotModel(std::string inFilename, std::string inDeviceName, 
                    ChppDeviceShPtr &outDevice, 
                    std::string inDirectory=
                    std::string("OPENHRP_PREFIX")+std::string("/etc"))
     where OPENHRP_PREFIX is the installation prefix of OpenHRP resolved at
     configuration.

  5. ktStatus
     loadObstacleModel(std::string inFilename, std::string inObstacleName, 
                       CkppKCDPolyhedronShPtr &outPolyhedron, 
                       std::string inOpenHrpPrefix=
                       std::string("OPENHRP_PREFIX"))

     has been replaced by

     ktStatus 
     loadObstacleModel(std::string inFilename, std::string inObstacleName, 
                       CkppKCDPolyhedronShPtr& outPolyhedron,
                       std::string inDirectory=
                       std::string("@OPENHRP_PREFIX@")+std::string("/etc/"));

     where OPENHRP_PREFIX is the installation prefix of OpenHRP resolved at
     configuration.


     In Changes 2, 3, 4, and 5, using the default argument to specify paths
     yields the same behavior as formerly.
